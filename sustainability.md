# Set up MongoDB Database
The project code is currently set up with a private MongoDB account. 
You will need to set up a new account for the team and change the uri credentials on line 10 of index.js.
Account creation was free and a free account should provide enough space. A basic understanding of how Mongo collections are formatted and queried is encouraged. MongoDB offers a free intro. course on their MongoDB University site.

The original set up for a quiz collection was each document was a quiz with a description, name, category, points possible, and an array of questions. Each question was its own object with the question text, an array of choices, an answer, and point value.

Student documents contained an email, display name, and an array of past quiz results.
